    "Simon Says" is a classic memory game that tests players' ability to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. Each round, the game generates a new sequence that is one color longer than the previous sequence, challenging the player to remember an ever-growing list of colors. The game involves several key steps and features, making it both engaging and challenging.

    - **Display Sequence:** The game displays a sequence of colors. Each color is highlighted one at a time for the player to memorize. The sequence starts with a single color and increases by one color with each level.
    - **Player Input:** After displaying the sequence, the player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the color buttons in the same order as they were displayed. The player's input is captured and stored for verification.
    - **Check Sequence:** The game checks if the player's input matches the displayed sequence. If the sequence matches, the player progresses to the next level. If not, the game ends.
    - **Next Level:** If the player correctly repeats the sequence, the game progresses to the next level. The sequence is then increased by one additional color, making it more challenging.
    - **Game Over:** If the player inputs the wrong sequence, the game is over. The player is then informed of the level they reached, encouraging them to try again and beat their previous score.

    This game uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. It provides an engaging way for players to test and improve their memory skills.
